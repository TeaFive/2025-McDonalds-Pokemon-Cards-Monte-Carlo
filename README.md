# Monte Carlo: 2025 McDonald's Pokemon Cards
This project explores the happy meals from McDonald's 2025 collaboration with Pokemon. Each meal came with a card pack. 
There are fifteen cards in total to collect- seven holofoil and eight standard cards. 

Purely out of interest, curiosity, and a little bit of boredom, I sought to answer:
**"How many Happy Meals would I have to buy to get all fifteen cards?"**

## Future Plans
Currently, expansion on this project is on pause while I'm focused on academics. However, I'm satisfied in reaching a decent stopping point. In the future, I hope to revisit it with:
- Bootstrapping and confidence intervals
- Variance reduction techniques
- Adjusted simulations based on **non-uniform** empirical data (e.g. from real-world collector submissions)
