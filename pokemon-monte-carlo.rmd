title: "Monte Carlo: 2025 McDonalds Pokemon Cards"

# Background and Motivation
I was a big fan of the Pokemon games (and I still am!) growing up. While I did start a small Pokemon card
collection, I was never serious about being a collector or trading card game (TCG) player. The cards always 
have pretty and unique art that I enjoy admiring.

On January 21, 2025, McDonalds and Pokemon announced a collaboration, introducing the 
[Pokemon Happy Meal](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/mcdonalds-pokemon-happy-meals-collaboration).
Each Happy Meal came with a four-card booster pack. The collaboration had a set of fifteen cards to collect-- 
seven holofoil and eight standard cards.

Out of boredom, I wondered: "*How many Happy Meals would I have to buy to get all fifteen cards?*" Of
course, I wasn't going to spend who-knows-how-much on Happy Meals-- it'd be a lot more faster (and healthier) 
to run simulations!

# Mathematical Analysis
This is a variation of the [coupon collector's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem)
but with an extra step. Each Happy Meal guarantees one holofoil card and three standard cards with no duplicates.
We can treat this as if the holofoil and standard cards are pulled from separate pools. In other words, the expectated
number of Happy Meals needed to get all holofoil cards and standard cards are independent of each other.

## Expectation of Holofoil Cards
Let $H$ be the number of Happy Meals required to collect all seven holofoil cards. Let $h_i$ be the number
of meals needed to collect the $i$-th new holofoil card after $i-1$ cards have been collected. Note that each 
$h_i$ follows a [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution)-- that is,
the number of trials for a first success. The total number of meals is $H = h_1 + h_2 + ... + h_7$.

Now, we can calculate the expectation of $H$:
$$ \begin{align*}
    E(H) & = E(h_1 + h_2 + ... + h_7) \\
         & = \sum_{i=1}^{7} E(h_i) && \text{linearity of expectation}\\
         & = \sum_{i=1}^{7} \frac{7}{7-i+1} \\
         & = \frac{7}{7} + \frac{7}{7-1} + ... + \frac{7}{1} \\
         & = 7 \cdot H_7 && \text{where } H_7 \text{ is the 7th harmonic number} \\
         & \approx 18.15 \text{ Happy Meals}
\end{align*}$$

## Expectation of Standard Cards
Calculating the expectation of the standard cards is similar to the holofoil expectation, but we now have
to account for the fact that three cards are pulled per pack, meaning we have to account for the possibility
of getting 0, 1, 2, or 3 new cards. 

We'll follow the [hypergeometric distriubtion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution).
% Suppose I draw $k$ given a total of $N$ items 

Let $N$ be the number of new cards, and let $i$ represent the number of unique cards already obtained.
$$\begin{align*}
    E[N \mid i] & = 3 \cdot \frac{8-i}{8}
\end{align*}$$

Let $S$ be the number of Happy Meals required to collect all eight standard cards.

$$
    E(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{8} \frac{1}{i}
$$

## Putting It Together

# Monte Carlo Simulation 

```{r}
random_card <- sample(1:7, 1)
print(random_card)
```
